Title: Welcome to ChamberOfCommerceAI

Body:
ChamberOfCommerceAI is a community-driven platform built to help Chambers across the U.S. collaborate on local commerce. The goal is simple: let’s band together so businesses and customers are fully served with trusted recommendations and reviews of local businesses.

Created by **Aaron Bentley**, AI Solution Architect and Founder of **Mahoosuc Solutions**, and an architect serving on the executive board of the **Bethel, Maine Chamber of Commerce**.

If you’re a Chamber leader, business owner, or community partner, we’d love your input on priorities and pilot opportunities.
