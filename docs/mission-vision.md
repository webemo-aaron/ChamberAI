# Mission + Vision (Outreach One-Pager)

## Mission

Unite Chambers of Commerce across the U.S. around a shared, trusted platform for local commerce—so businesses and customers are fully served with recommendations, reviews, and community resources.

## Vision

A single, interoperable platform where Chambers collaborate instead of competing in isolation. Local businesses gain visibility across regions, residents get trustworthy guidance, and Chambers gain modern tools for governance, meetings, and shared commerce initiatives.

## Why Now

Local businesses face global competition and fragmented marketing channels. Chambers are already trusted institutions, but they lack a unified digital platform that connects communities. ChamberOfCommerceAI aims to close that gap.

## What We’re Building

- A shared recommendations and reviews layer across Chambers
- A local commerce directory powered by Chamber data
- Collaboration tools for governance, meetings, and minutes
- A platform that can be self-hosted or centrally hosted

## Who It’s For

- Chamber executives and boards
- Local businesses and entrepreneurs
- Regional partners and economic development teams
