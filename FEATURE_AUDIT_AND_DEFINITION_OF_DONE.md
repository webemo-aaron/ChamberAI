## Resource Requirements

### **Free Tier (Open Source)**
- **Time**: 20-30 hours (documentation + deployment guides)
- **Cost**: $0 (your time only)
- **Skills**: You + community contributions
- **Infrastructure**: Users' own servers

### **Paid Tier (SaaS)**
- **Time**: 300-400 hours (core development)
- **Cost**: $5-10K (GCP, Stripe, etc.)
- **Skills**: Backend engineer (1), Frontend engineer (0.5), DevOps (0.5)
- **Infrastructure**: GCP Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud CDN

---

## Decision Points

### **Q1: Should we open source immediately?**
- **YES** if: Want community contributions, building trust
- **NO** if: Planning SaaS first, concerned about competitors

**Recommendation**: **YES** - Open source the free tier, keep premium features closed source

### **Q2: How do we price the paid tier?**
- **Per-seat** ($9-29/user/month) - Scales with team size
- **Per-organization** ($99-299/month) - Flat rate
- **Usage-based** ($0.01-0.10 per action) - Pay for what you use
- **Hybrid** (Combination of above)

**Recommendation**: **Per-organization** ($99-299/month) - Simple, predictable, aligns with CAM business model

### **Q3: Which premium features first?**
- **Analytics Dashboard** - High ROI, high demand
- **Advanced AI** - Differentiation, hard to replicate
- **CRM Integration** - Zoho ONE strategy (you mentioned in CLAUDE.md)

**Recommendation**: **Advanced AI** + **CRM Integration** (leverages Zoho, aligns with strategy)

---

## Success Metrics

### **Free Tier Success**
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 10+ fork by week 4
- 2+ pull requests from community
- <100 issues (well-managed)

### **Paid Tier Success**
- 10+ beta users by month 3
- 80%+ month-over-month retention
- $5K MRR by month 6
- NPS score >50

---

## Next Actions

**To move forward, you need to decide:**

1. **Timing**: When do you want to open source? (Immediately, after SaaS MVP, etc.)
2. **Licensing**: MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL?
3. **Pricing**: Per-seat, per-org, or usage-based?
4. **Features**: Which premium features to implement first?
5. **Team**: Will you hire contractors/employees for SaaS development?

Once you decide these, I can:
- ✅ Create the deployment guides
- ✅ Set up feature flag system for free/paid split
- ✅ Draft the pricing page
- ✅ Create the SaaS infrastructure plan
- ✅ Write the legal documents (Terms, Privacy, DPA)
